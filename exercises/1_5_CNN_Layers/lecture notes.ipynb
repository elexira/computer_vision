When a patch of filter (5x5x3) moves on a verticle line, the sum of values on the patch will be large. Relu(large value) = large value. This behaviro is also explained by \"the filter is activated\". So this filter will show patches of large values in its resulting 800x800 feature map (example above) after activation. \n",

    "Last Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to looking at the first layer(s) of a CNN, we can take the opposite approach, and look at the last linear layer in a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that the output of a classification CNN, is a fully-connected class score layer, and one layer before that is a feature vector that represents the content of the input image in some way. This feature vector is produced after an input image has gone through all the layers in the CNN, and it contains enough distinguishing information to classify the image.\n",
    "\n",
    " Final Feature Vector\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how can we understand whatâ€™s going on in this final feature vector? What kind of information has it distilled from an image?\n",
    "\n",
    "To visualize what a vector represents about an image, we can compare it to other feature vectors, produced by the same CNN as it sees different input images. We can run a bunch of different images through a CNN and record the last feature vector for each image. This creates a feature space, where we can compare how similar these vectors are to one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can measure vector-closeness by looking at the nearest neighbors in feature space. Nearest neighbors for an image is just an image that is near to it; that matches its pixels values as closely as possible. So, an image of an orange basketball will closely match other orange basketballs or even other orange, round shapes like an orange fruit, as seen below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nearest neighbors in feature space\n",
    "\n",
    "In feature space, the nearest neighbors for a given feature vector are the vectors that most closely match that one; we typically compare these with a metric like MSE or L1 distance. And these images may or may not have similar pixels, which the nearest-neighbor pixel images do; instead they have very similar content, which the feature vector has distilled.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, to visualize the last layer in a CNN, we ask: which feature vectors are closest to one another and which images do those correspond to?\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Dimensionality reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Another method for visualizing this last layer in a CNN is to reduce the dimensionality of the final feature vector so that we can display it in 2D or 3D space.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say we have a CNN that produces a 256-dimension vector (a list of 256 values). In this case, our task would be to reduce this 256-dimension vector into 2 dimensions that can then be plotted on an x-y axis. There are a few techniques that have been developed for compressing data like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal Component Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "One is PCA, principal component analysis, which takes a high dimensional vector and compresses it down to two dimensions. It does this by looking at the feature space and creating two variables (x, y) that are functions of these features; these two variables want to be as different as possible, which means that the produced x and y end up separating the original feature data distribution by as large a margin as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "t-SNE\n",
    "\n",
    "Another really powerful method for visualization is called t-SNE (pronounced, tea-SNEE), which stands for t-distributed stochastic neighbor embeddings. Itâ€™s a non-linear dimensionality reduction that, again, aims to separate data in a way that clusters similar data close together and separates differing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, below is a t-SNE reduction done on the MNIST dataset, which is a dataset of thousands of 28x28 images, similar to FashionMNIST, where each image is one of 10 hand-written digits 0-9.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Other Feature Visualization Techniques\n",

    "\n",
    "### Occlusion Experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "Occlusion means to block out or mask part of an image or object. For example, if you are looking at a person but their face is behind a book; this person's face is hidden (occluded). Occlusion can be used in feature visualization by blocking out selective parts of an image and seeing how a network responds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process for an occlusion experiment is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Mask part of an image before feeding it into a trained CNN,\n",
    "    Draw a heatmap of class scores for each masked image,\n",
    "    Slide the masked area to a different spot and repeat steps 1 and 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result should be a heatmap that shows the predicted class of an image as a function of which part of an image was occluded. The reasoning is that if the class score for a partially occluded image is different than the true class, then the occluded area was likely very important!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Saliency Maps\n",
    "\n",
    "Salience can be thought of as the importance of something, and for a given image, a saliency map asks: Which pixels are most important in classifying this image?\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all pixels in an image are needed or relevant for classification. In the image of the elephant above, you don't need all the information in the image about the background and you may not even need all the detail about an elephant's skin texture; only the pixels that distinguish the elephant from any other animal are important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Saliency maps aim to show these important pictures by computing the gradient of the class score with respect to the image pixels. A gradient is a measure of change, and so, the gradient of the class score with respect to the image pixels is a measure of how much a class score for an image changes if a pixel changes a little bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measuring change\n",
    "\n",
    "A saliency map tells us, for each pixel in an input image, if we change it's value slightly (by dp), how the class output will change. If the class scores change a lot, then the pixel that experienced a change, dp, is important in the classification task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the saliency map below, you can see that it identifies the most important pixels in classifying an image of a flower. These kinds of maps have even been used to perform image segmentation (imagine the map overlay acting as an image mask)!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Guided Backpropagation\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the process for constructing a saliency map, you can compute the gradients for mid level neurons in a network with respect to the input pixels. Guided backpropagation looks at each pixel in an input image, and asks: if we change it's pixel value slightly, how will the output of a particular neuron or layer in the network change. If the expected output change a lot, then the pixel that experienced a change, is important to that particular layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is very similar to the backpropagation steps for measuring the error between an input and output and propagating it back through a network. Guided backpropagation tells us exactly which parts of the image patches, that weâ€™ve looked at, activate a specific neuron/layer.\n",
